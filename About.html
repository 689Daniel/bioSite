				<p>Tammy is a CPA. She has had her license for over two decades and has worked mostly with small businesses. 
				She handles monthly accounting, as well as more tax work during the busy season. 
				Her hours are comfortable most of the year but become intense during tax season. 
				She received her license in 1997. After interning during college, she started in public accounting working full-time for a firm. 
				It wasn’t until 2000 that she started her own business. She started a part-time business by working for clients on the side, and she switched to full-time self-employment when she was pregnant. 
				It was easy to start, and while others struggled to find clients, she had no problems.</p>
				<p>In school, Tammy got good grades, but she did not take a real interest in learning until college. <q>“I lived and breathed studying,”</q> she remembers. Her college experience was made easier with support from friends in her major, and she graduated on the dean’s list with honors.</p>
				<p>Tammy enjoys spending what little free time she has among several hobbies. 
				She enjoys gardening, reading, and doing puzzles. She spends her time with her son and her husband, both of whom live with her. 
				She also spends time with her mother, friends from church, and her stepson, his wife, and their children. 
				In addition to people, Tammy also lives alongside Margo the beagle, Fluttershy the sugar glider, Yoshi the leopard gecko, and several chickens. Squirrels and birds also pay frequent visits at the feeders outside.</p>
				<p>Among her achievements, Tammy lists raising her son and creating the successful business that she’s had. 
				In the near future, she looks forward to retirement. When she retires, she hopes to use her new-found time to pursue various hobbies and interests. 
				Particularly, she hopes to spend more time on her spring gardening and to harvest more from her fruit trees so she can make her own baked goods to share with friends and family.</p>
