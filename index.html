				<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
				<p>Currently, Tammy’s biggest future goal is retirement. 
				She hopes to retire soon, and when she does, she wants to spend more time in her garden and have fruit trees in abundance so she can bake and can her own produce to share. 
				She also wants to have the time to help personally remodel her house with her husband, including landscaping work and interior do-it-yourself projects. She hopes to have the time for these and other projects once she retires. 
				Ultimately, she wants to be someone people know they can come to for help and guidance and trust.</p>
